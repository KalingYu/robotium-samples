Obtain the apk. Either:
    
    * Download apk directly from vendor's homepage, or...
    
    * via Market on your phone:
        install the apk from market
        find it:
            start a command shell
            become root if you need to: su
            find / -iname '*partofname*.apk'
            (on my phone, some were found in /system/sd/app/ and /system/sd/app-private/)
        cp /file_location/the_filename.apk /sdcard/
        copy it to your computer, by mounting the sdcard or using File Browser in DDMS in Eclipse.


Figure out the application's package id, and the LAUNCHER Activity's class:
/opt/android/platforms/android-7/tools/aapt dump xmltree original.apk AndroidManifest.xml|less

    Browse to the top and find 'A: package=' just below 'E: manifest'.
    That's the application's package id.

    Search for LAUNCHER: hit '/' and type LAUNCHER. Then press ENTER. You may need to press 'N' (SHIFT-n) to search backwards.
    Scroll up with your arrow keys, to the first line before it, which starts with 'E: activity'.
    Then follow it down to 'A: android:name'.
    That's your LAUNCHER Activity's class name. (If it starts with a '.', add the package id at the beginning.)

    Exit from less with 'q'.

./sign-debug-any-apk.sh original.apk debugsigned.apk
adb install debugsigned.apk
(if unsuccessful, you may need to 'adb uninstall com.whatever.the.package.id.is' before installing.)


In your test project's AndroidManifest.xml in Eclipse, set the target package to the package id you found above.

Write your test class like this:
(the example here is for NewsRob)


package com.yourcompany.yourtestname;

import com.jayway.android.robotium.solo.Solo;

import android.test.ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2;

@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public class ReallyBlackboxTest extends ActivityInstrumentationTestCase2 {

	private static final String TARGET_PACKAGE_ID = "com.newsrob";
	private static final String LAUNCHER_ACTIVITY_FULL_CLASSNAME = "com.newsrob.DashboardListActivity";

	private static Class<?> launcherActivityClass;
	static{
		try {
			launcherActivityClass = Class.forName(LAUNCHER_ACTIVITY_FULL_CLASSNAME);
		} catch (ClassNotFoundException e) {
			throw new RuntimeException(e);
		}
	}
	
	@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
	public ReallyBlackboxTest() throws ClassNotFoundException {
		super(TARGET_PACKAGE_ID, launcherActivityClass);
	}
	
	private Solo solo;
	
	@Override
	protected void setUp() throws Exception {
		solo = new Solo(getInstrumentation(), getActivity());
	}
	
	public void testActivityAppears(){
		solo.assertCurrentActivity("Correct activity did not appear.", launcherActivityClass);
	}
	
	public void testCanOpenSettings(){
		solo.pressMenuItem(0);
	}

	public void testCanOpenSettingsSynchronization(){
		testCanOpenSettings();
		solo.clickOnText("Synchronization");
	}

}
